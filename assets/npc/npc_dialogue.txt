Squid lady (lobby?):
Strange strangely strange things going on these days. Almost got taken out by a giant head yesterday.
I never really liked that Lord Triton fellow. But with him gone I can’t even leave unless I want to get killed.


Drunk guy (lobby):
Hello mysterious man. My name is Tim. 
Ya know I feel like I’ve seen your face somewhere before…
Best be careful it’s not too safe anywhere right now. Better to just sit and drown your sorrows I say.


Old guy (before final boss fight):
Oh… oh… OH! finally you have returned! I thought I might die before I saw you again my lord. THAT guy has stolen everything. I’ve been keeping my eye on him.
HE MUST DIIIEEEEEE! Kill him kill him kill him!


Blue guy (around the maps):
1st encounter:
Get lost fool.

2nd encounter:
The world is better off now than it was under you.

3rd encounter:
You were a failure of a king.


Red lady (reoccurring poet?)(in the 3 side rooms): 
First encounter:
Amongst the drifting reeds tonight,
A little shell glistens in the moonlight,
It is such a tiny little shell,
Oh such a tiny little shell I see.
A poem by me.

Second encounter:
In every clam there is a little man,
A little man and a little woman.
What are they doing in there I wonder?
What a peaceful life so far down under.
A poem by me.
It’s a metaphor.

Third encounter:
There is an abyss in the Yellow Sea,
It swallows everything there might be,
Oh be warned little fishy, be warned,
For there lives Triton, by all scorned.
A poem by me.
