## 🕹 Gameplay Overview

**Seas the Throne** is a 2D pixel-art action-adventure set in the turbulent aftermath of Triton’s mysterious disappearance.  
You play as a swordfish humanoid hero, fighting through waves of hostile sea creatures to seize the throne of the underwater kingdom.

The game combines **bullet-hell dodging**, **resource-based combat**, and **strategic melee attacks** in a fast-paced, challenging experience.

### ⚔️ Core Mechanics

- **Dash and Spear:**  
  Skewer enemy fish by dashing through them at high velocity. Careful movement is key — a mistimed dash will leave you vulnerable.
  
- **Fling Collected Fish:**  
  Use speared fish as ammunition to launch ranged counterattacks. Manage your limited ammo and choose your moments wisely.

- **Risky Melee Combat:**  
  Brave players can dive into enemy territory for direct melee strikes, dealing greater damage but exposing themselves to more risk.

- **Bullet-Hell Dodging:**  
  Navigate dense, patterned enemy fire while maintaining momentum. Learn enemy attack rhythms to survive and retaliate.

- **Strategic Movement:**  
  Dashing provides a burst of speed but is constrained by cooldowns and limited space, creating intense decision-making moments in tight arenas.

### 🌊 World and Story

As players fight to the throne, they'll uncover clues about Triton's disappearance through:
- **Environmental storytelling**
- **Ancient tablets hidden in levels**
- **NPC dialogue before boss battles**

Was Triton murdered, trapped, or did he vanish willingly? Only those who survive the ocean's greatest dangers will find the answer.
