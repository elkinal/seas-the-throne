### ⚔️ Core Mechanics

- **Dash and Spear:**  
  Skewer enemy fish by dashing through them at high velocity. Careful movement is key — a mistimed dash will leave you vulnerable.
  
- **Fling Collected Fish:**  
  Use speared fish as ammunition to launch ranged counterattacks. Manage your limited ammo and choose your moments wisely.

- **Risky Melee Combat:**  
  Brave players can dive into enemy territory for direct melee strikes, dealing greater damage but exposing themselves to more risk.

- **Bullet-Hell Dodging:**  
  Navigate dense, patterned enemy fire while maintaining momentum. Learn enemy attack rhythms to survive and retaliate.

- **Strategic Movement:**  
  Dashing provides a burst of speed but is constrained by cooldowns and limited space, creating intense decision-making moments in tight arenas.
